<h1>Not Safe Here</h1>

<p>Not Safe Here is a collaborative web service which
aims to help users to add and find criminal activities based on
their locations or one selected. This application makes use of the
AWS (Amazon Web Services) and is developed using the MEAN
(Mongodb, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) stack with the Google
Map API. </p>

<p>I develop this tool to learn how to use the MEAN stack</p>
